I don't write a lot of personal code that I can actually show people these days.
This repository contains some 12+ year old code, some from college. It is not representative
of my normal work, but it's here. 

If you have any suggestions or comments for me regarding any of 
this, please let me know using whatever means of communication 
Github provides you. Thanks in advance.
